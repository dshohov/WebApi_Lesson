For help in development, please contact me via my e-mail. The subject for help can be a bug or suggestions for improving the code, adding new options for the development of the application.

## Why was this project developed?
This project was written for my concept of Web Api. So that in the future I can easily write Web Api and understand how to work with it. Thanks to this, I can now write applications with a microservice architecture that are easier to maintain and debug, and also convenient to extend the code.
